\begin{abstract}
The technology of Virtual Reality (VR) currently is not cost effective to today's market, as the cost of high-end setups required makes it difficult to afford. Browser developers are focusing primarily on expensive high-end high-performance hardware over mobile devices for Augmented Reality (AR) or Virtual Reality (VR) on the web. Doing AR/VR on the mobile web allows more developers to enter the field and deliver to more customers. To accomplish this, we are working on a project called “Mobile AR/VR Performance”, which focuses on researching to profile and identify performance bottlenecks in 3D web content on mobile devices. We will file issues in the open source projects for Chrome, Firefox through A-Frame and Three.js to determine and identify those bottlenecks. We hope to accomplish this by reporting the challenges and opportunities for performance VR/AR applications, and write a blog post detailing the project results and their best-practices.

\begin{enumerate}[labelsep=2em,leftmargin=.5in]
    {\item \bfseries Virtual Reality (VR): } Computer generated three-dimensional environment that immerses the user into the environment using special equipment or implementation techniques. \vspace{.1cm}
    {\item \bfseries Augmented Reality (AR): } Provides a composite view to the user based on computer generated environments super-imposed onto the view of the real world. \vspace{.1cm}
    {\item \bfseries Operating System (OS): } Software that supports an interface to support computer's basic functions, such as process scheduling, executing tasks, and allowing user interface. Specifically this project is in regards to Android OS. \vspace{.1cm}
    {\item \bfseries Web Framework: } A software framework that is designed to support the development of web applications including web services, web resources and web APIs. \vspace{.1cm}
    {\item \bfseries A-Frame: } A-Frame is an open-source WebVR framework for creating virtual reality (VR) experiences with HTML with the use of the Three.js framework.\vspace{.1cm}
    {\item \bfseries Three.js: } JavaScript framework that allows accessible development WebGL applications. \vspace{.1cm}
    {\item \bfseries WebGL: } JavaScript API that allows for rendering interactive 3D and 2D computer graphics within any compatible web browser without the use of plug-ins. \vspace{.1cm}
    {\item \bfseries Viewport: } A viewport is a viewing region in computer graphics. This region is defined in the software to allow for viewing the drawing of objects. This viewport is typically bounded by a window or by the full screen of the mobile device. \vspace{.1cm}
    {\item \bfseries Local Web Server: } A webs erver for hosting web page content to allow access on local networks, without having to go out into the internet to access the information. \vspace{.1cm}
    {\item \bfseries Hosted Web Server: } A server that is hosted externally on the internet, where it holds and displays the web information, needing to go out to the internet, and back again to receive the proper information. \vspace{.1cm}
    {\item \bfseries Implementation Languages: } a formal computer language or constructed language designed to communicate instructions to a machine, particularly a computer. i.e. HTML, JavaScript, C, C++, etc. \vspace{.1cm}
    {\item \bfseries Mobile Devices: } A device that is able to be held and portable by a user, typically a smart phone or table.t\vspace{.1cm}
    {\item \bfseries Rendering: } Part of the graphical process that draws everything into the "view's" scene. This includes textures, animations, objects, surface information, etc. \vspace{.1cm}
    {\item \bfseries Bottleneck: } An effect impeding on the rendering process, which occurs between the hardware and software aspects. \vspace{.1cm}
    {\item \bfseries Optimize: } Process of making something as fully functional or effective as possible, including the types of limitations that occur in the environment. \vspace{.1cm}
    {\item \bfseries Performance: } The process of how well the software handles the action or function of the software.
    {\item \bfseries Software Bug: } An error, flaw, failure or fault in the system that causes it to produce an incorrect or unexpected result, or to behave in unintended ways. \vspace{.1cm}
    %{\item \bfseries [word]: } Something \vspace{.1cm}
