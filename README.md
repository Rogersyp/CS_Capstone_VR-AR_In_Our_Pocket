# CS_Capstone_VR-AR_In_Our_Pocket
Optimizing Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) performance on Mobile Web

### About:

This is best viewed through a VR viewing device, such as Google Cardboard and any compatible Android mobile device. For a full list of compatible devices, please check this [website](https://webvr.info/) for more information.

This is a Virtual Reality WebVR program that is built using the A-Frame framework. It allows VR to be rendered through WebGL and Three.JS to create environments through browsers on mobile devices. This project is accessible from two platforms, a mobile device's web browser (Google Chrome or [FireFox BETA](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mozilla.firefox_beta&hl=en)), and a desktop browser (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox - or the developer builds - [Google Chromium](https://webvr.info/get-chrome/), [Firefox Nightly](https://webvr.rocks/firefox)).

### To Install:

* Clone the repository and navigate to the /A-Frame/ Folder
* Host /A-Frame/ on a localhost server.
* Have Internet Access to load the A-Frame framework scripts for their API.

Alternatively, you can access the most recently updated version of this project directly on our [website](http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~siebertc/aframe/Capstone/CS_Capstone_VR-AR_In_Our_Pocket/A-Frame/)

### To Use:

* To begin, access index.html for the "lobby."
* Face the panels around you, place the circle cursor onto the object, and click or tap on the page.
* Room 3 and Room 4 have interactions to turn on multiple lights by looking at them.
* Enjoy the stress tests and "scenery"!
